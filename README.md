This is an app built to show flashcards using react-native.
It should be able to be run by using npm install and yarn start, using Expo.

This has been tested in iOS.

Note to reviewer - a warning will be displayed for notifications. As far as I can tell, this is unavoidable due to the rubric requirement for setting a repeated notification and changes to iOS.
